<p>
The Met Office, in collaboration with the University of Leeds, assessed available scientific evidence on the co-benefits of adaptation and mitigation options related to heat-health risk, flood risk, and air quality for global regions. This platform provides the results of that assessment, including modifiable options for searches, and downloadable visualisations.
</p>
<p>
For this assessment, (co)benefits included both the direct benefits of averted impacts due to climate change, as well as the indirect (incidental) co-benefits of mitigation strategies. ‘Trade-offs’ include both the direct (not averted) impacts, as well as the indirect, new, or unanticipated emerging risks that arise from different adaptation and mitigation scenarios. Trade-offs (sometimes called ‘co-risks’) thus represent negative outcomes, while (co)benefits reflect positive outcomes, regardless of whether they are planned, unanticipated, direct, or incidental.
</p>
<p>
The assessment highlights key areas where the evidence suggests interventions may have high risk of trade-off (red) or benefit (green), and includes confidence in evidence. The assessment also provides insight into the degree to which the benefits and trade-offs of particular interventions might be sensitive to different contexts, focusing on success and equity: Are interventions more or less successful in some contexts compared to others? Are there particularly high equity implications for how benefits or trade-offs are likely to be distributed? Assessment results are also available disaggregated by global region.
</p>
<p>
Evidence on co-benefits and trade-offs of mitigation and adaptation interventions is still emerging and remains somewhat limited. Many relevant documents do not use standardized terminology or are not clearly identifiable, and will thus have been excluded from this assessment. Lack of evidence in this assessment does not imply lack of benefit or trade-off, but rather lack of sufficient evidence at this point in time.
</p>
<p>
This assessment is based on a systematic review of scientific literature on co-benefits and trade-offs, with results disaggregated by 6 global regions (Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, and South & Central America). The assessment follows the ROSES Reporting Standards for Systematic Evidence Synthesis, and includes assessment of confidence in evidence using an integrated approach that combines the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’s uncertainty guidance with the GRADE-CerQual approach to assessing confidence in evidence.
